# RecoFace-Marking
This is a face recognition attendance system call RecoFace Marking which makes the teachers job easier
I have chosen the Face Recognition -Attendance Marking System….. I have decided it will be useful to have a machine to do the attendance for them instead of them counting heads and calling out names. This project saves lots of time and eco friendly. Because of these reason I have chosen this project…..
In this project here you must collect some images of friend or any people and make a database. Using a webcam, you have to identify faces and detect whether captured image match with the image in database; if yes then show present otherwise show absent hence it makes the teachers job easier.
